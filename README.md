## Understanding Flight Delays ‚úàÔ∏è

Flight delays are a significant challenge for both the airline and passengers, causing disruptions, financial losses, and dissatisfaction.

Aanalyze historical flight data to uncover delay patterns, identify operational inefficiencies, and predict delays before they occur. By identifying delay patterns, predicting delays, and uncovering the factors that contribute most to delays.

These insights will help the airline make data-driven decisions to optimize scheduling, improve on-time performance, and enhance passenger satisfaction.

## üéØ Key Finding

1. ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Delay Statistics ‚Äì Insights from the Data

    - **61.15 %** of flights that experienced a departure delay also arrived late.
    - **15.37 %** of flights were delayed at departure but still managed to arrive on time.
    - **23.48 %** of flights that departed on time ended up arriving late.
    
So it's important to foucs on decreasing number of flights delayed at departure airport.
